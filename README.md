# ArduinoPowerMirror
Simple project i used to control old 5 pin power mirrors of Volkswagen golf III 1995 <img src="https://d3inagkmqs1m6q.cloudfront.net/1517/media-photos/cp045968-lh-exterior-side-view-door-mirror-93-99-vw-jetta-golf-gti-mk3-power-genuine-2.jpg" float= "left" width= "50%" height= "width" /><br>
with modern 10-pin joystick controller of VW jetta <br><img src="https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1kc4MOVXXXXaLaXXXq6xXFXXX3/Side-Mirror-Heat-Controller-Knob-Switch-For-VW-Passat-Jetta-Golf-Beetle-Auto-Replacement-Parts-Heat.jpg" float= "left" width= "50%" height= "width" />

## future version
Improved version i planned did include comparing value of known resistor to the resistance of the controller, but gearset inside the right side mirror broke, so i didn't develop this further. 
<br>
Main functionality is gained through control of the relay block. By reversing polarity and directing electricity to motors or defog resistors, satisfiable result was gained. 
<br>
## field testing
As mentioned before, right mirror's gears broke, so i didn't attach the planned mirrors to my car. Thus, i haven't tested these during winter or long, rainy seasons.
<br>
Preferably, arduino and relay would be in a waterproof case, preventing any potenital problems caused by water condensing on the pcb.
